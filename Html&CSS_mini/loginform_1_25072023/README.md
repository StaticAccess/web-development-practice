## Customization

The login form is designed to be customizable, allowing you to make changes to the button style, colors, background image, and icons. Below are the instructions for each customization option:

### How to Edit the Button Style

To edit the button style, modify the `button` CSS class in the `styles.css` file.

1. Open the `styles.css` file.
2. Locate the `.button` CSS class definition.
3. You can change the `background-color`, `color`, `border`, and other properties to customize the button appearance.
4. Save the changes and reload the page to see the updated button style.

### How to Change Colors

To change the colors used in the login form, update the corresponding CSS classes in the `styles.css` file.

1. Open the `styles.css` file.
2. Find the CSS classes you want to modify, such as `.container`, `.input-group`, or `.login-form`.
3. Adjust the `background-color`, `color`, `border`, and other properties to change the colors.
4. Save the changes and reload the page to see the updated colors.

### How to Customize the Background Image

To customize the background image of the login form, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your desired background image. Make sure it is in a web-compatible format such as `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.gif`.
2. Save the image file in the same directory as the `index.html` file.
3. Open the `styles.css` file.
4. Find the `.container` CSS class.
5. Update the `background-image` property with the path to your background image:

   ```css
   .container {
     background-image: url('path/to/your/background-image.jpg');
     /* ...other properties... */
   }
   ```

6. Save the changes and reload the page to see the updated background image.

### How to Add or Remove Icons

The login form uses Font Awesome icons for decorative purposes. To add or remove icons, modify the corresponding HTML code in the `index.html` file.

1. To add an icon, find the appropriate element and add the Font Awesome icon's HTML code:

   ```html
   <i class="fas fa-icon-name"></i>
   ```

   Replace `icon-name` with the specific name of the icon you want to add. You can find the list of available icons on the Font Awesome website.

2. To remove an icon, simply delete the corresponding `<i>` tag containing the icon's class.

3. Save the changes and reload the page to see the updated icon appearance.
