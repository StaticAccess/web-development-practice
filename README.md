## Introduction

As someone passionate about web development, I have created this repository to centralize my projects, code snippets, and experiments. Whether it's front-end development, back-end development, or full-stack projects, this space will be my sandbox for hands-on learning.

## Technologies

I plan to work with a variety of technologies in this repository, including but not limited to:

- HTML and CSS
- JavaScript and ES6+
- Front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js)
- Back-end frameworks (e.g., Node.js, Django, Flask)
- Database systems (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB)
- Server deployment and management (e.g., Docker, Nginx)
